# Machine Learning & Deep Learning From Scratch

## Overview

This repository is a personal learning project focused on **understanding Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms from first principles**.

The goal is not only to use existing libraries, but to **deeply understand how algorithms work mathematically and algorithmically**, by:
- deriving the theory and equations,
- implementing algorithms **from scratch**,
- and comparing them with standard implementations using libraries such as **scikit-learn** and **PyTorch**.

This project is designed to serve as a **long-term reference** for revisiting any algorithm and understanding it end-to-end.

## Project Philosophy

For each algorithm or model, the work follows a consistent structure:

1. **Theory & Intuition**
   - Problem formulation
   - Intuitive explanation
   - Mathematical derivation
   - Assumptions, limitations, and use cases

2. **Implementation From Scratch**
   - Implemented using basic tools (mainly NumPy)
   - Focus on clarity and understanding rather than performance
   - Step-by-step code with explanations

3. **Library-Based Implementation**
   - Implementation using standard ML/DL libraries (scikit-learn, PyTorch, etc.)
   - Comparison with the from-scratch version
   - Discussion of differences, optimizations, and abstractions
